# Peet

The IoT Pet Feeder project allows you to feed your pet remotely using a web-based interface. The pet feeder is controlled by an Arduino board connected to the internet. The Arduino communicates with a cloud-based MQTT broker, allowing it to receive commands from a web interface. When the user presses a button on the website, an MQTT message is sent, triggering the feeding mechanism.
